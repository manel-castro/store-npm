Implements a basic store for callbacks management with a minimum bundle size of less than 5kb.

Components to use:

```TS
getCallback()

setCallback()

deleteCallback()
```

You need to provide a uniqueId parameter.

All the library includes type declarations, but functions are self-explanatory for plain JS.
